# Basic-Python-Programs
These programs will help you gain basic practical understanding of how Python programming language works and how do you write a good and an efficient code in Python. These programs are more than just basic python programs -- they are small programs but bigger ideas and practical solutions can stem out from this. This was the beginning of my journey with Python programming language.
Programs that are included in this :
1. Currency converter without live data (currencyconverter.py) - User enters amount and currency of his choice and converts it to two other currency equivalents.
2. Sorting numbers from the list in ascending or descending order (ascenddescend.py) - User makes a list of numbers and then depending on his choice, the numbers can be retrieved from the list and sorted in ascending or descending order.
3. Searching for names present in the list by either typing out the full name or initial letters of the name (search.py) - Here you can learn to make a list of strings (names) and then search for names present in the list by typing out either the initial letters of the name or the full name and if it matches, it will return all the results or else no matching results.
4. Line,Character and Word Counter of a File saved by the user (filecounter.py) - User saves a text file say welcome.txt in the same folder where python program is stored and can find out the number of lines, characters and words in the text file.

The repository also includes the python programs which were a part of my assignments for 'Object Oriented Programming in Python' course at The University of Texas at Dallas.
It covers the fundamental topics such as - Conditional Execution, Functions, Iteration, Python Data Structures, Exception Handling, OOP Principles, Data Visualization with Python.
